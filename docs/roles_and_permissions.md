# Meltano Cloud - Roles and Permissions

## Role descriptions

- Users with the `owner` role access can create and delete projects, as well as performing all functions of `maintaner`. Owners can also view billing history and perform other account management functions, such as adding new users.
- Users with the `maintaner` role access can perform normal development and maintenance functions, such as updating schedules and executing jobs. Maintainers cannot add or delete projects or users.
- Users with the `reader` role only have read-only access: for instance, to view job statuses and summary logs.

## Future updates

Note:

- More advanced role-based access permissions may be added in future versions on Meltano Cloud.
